TheInterviewer
==============

A compilation of interview questions and their solutions grouped by language sets
The idea of this project is to compile solutions to common interview problems in different languages. This can be useful for:
- Practicing for interviews
- Practicing programming
- Get used to a new programming language by reviewing common usage

Different solutions may be provided once they prove a different approach to a problem. Solutions can be optimized. Code must be explained and well documented to provide help for another students
